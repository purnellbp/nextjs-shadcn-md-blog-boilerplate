# Getting Started with Next.js: A Beginner Guide

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building full-stack web applications simple and efficient. In this post, I'll walk you through the basics and help you create your first Next.js application.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides:

- **Server-side rendering** for better SEO and performance
- **File-based routing** for easy navigation
- **API routes** for backend functionality
- **Built-in optimizations** for images, fonts, and more
- **Zero configuration** setup

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

- Node.js installed (version 18.17 or later)
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Creating Your First Next.js App

The easiest way to get started is using the `create-next-app` command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
cd my-blog
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-blog/
├── app/                 # App Router (Next.js 13+)
│   ├── page.tsx        # Home page
│   ├── layout.tsx      # Root layout
│   └── globals.css     # Global styles
├── public/             # Static assets
├── components/         # Reusable components
└── package.json        # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Pages and Routing

In Next.js 13+ with the App Router, you create pages by adding files to the `app` directory:

- `app/page.tsx` → `/` (home page)
- `app/about/page.tsx` → `/about`
- `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` → `/blog/any-slug`

### 2. Layouts

Layouts allow you to share UI between pages:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### 3. Server Components

Next.js 13+ uses React Server Components by default, which means components run on the server and can directly access databases and APIs.

## Next Steps

Once you have your basic app running, you can:

1. **Add styling** with CSS modules, Tailwind CSS, or styled-components
2. **Create components** for reusable UI elements
3. **Add data fetching** with `getServerSideProps` or the new data fetching methods
4. **Deploy** to Vercel, Netlify, or any other hosting platform

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its developer experience, performance optimizations, and flexibility make it a great framework for both beginners and experienced developers.

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into specific Next.js features and show you how to build more complex applications.
