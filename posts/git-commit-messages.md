# The Art of Git Commit Messages: A Comedy in 50 Characters

Git commit messages are like haikus written under pressure. You have 50 characters to explain what you just broke... I mean, fixed.

## The Evolution of Commit Messages

### Early Days (Optimistic)
```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login bug
docs: update README
```

### Mid-Project (Desperate)
```
fix bug
wip
temp
test
```

### Late Night (Honest)
```
please work
why is this broken
i hate this
```

### 3 AM (Poetic)
```
it works now i think
magic happened
praying this fixes it
```

## Classic Commit Message Patterns

### The Vague
- `fix stuff`
- `update things`
- `more changes`

### The Honest
- `i have no idea what this does`
- `this should work maybe`
- `reverting my last commit`

### The Desperate
- `PLEASE WORK`
- `FINAL FIX`
- `LAST TRY`

### The Time-Based
- `3am fix`
- `lunch break update`
- `weekend work`

## The Perfect Commit Message Formula

According to conventional commits (that nobody follows):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Reality:
```
fix: it works now
```

## My Personal Favorites

```bash
git commit -m "fix the thing that was broken"
git commit -m "wip - don't merge this"
git commit -m "i'm tired"
git commit -m "ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
git commit -m "commit message"
```

## The Git Blame Game

Ever looked at a commit and thought "what was I thinking?" That's the beauty of git blame - it's like reading your own diary from 6 months ago.

## Commit Message Best Practices (That I Ignore)

1. **Use present tense** - "Add feature" not "Added feature"
2. **Be descriptive** - "Fix user authentication bug" not "fix bug"
3. **Keep it under 50 characters** - Good luck with that
4. **Use conventional commits** - `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.

## The Reality

Most of my commits look like:
```
fix
wip
test
fix again
really fix this time
```

## The Git History Story

Your git history tells a story:
- Chapter 1: "Initial commit"
- Chapter 2: "Add basic functionality"
- Chapter 3: "Fix bugs"
- Chapter 4: "More fixes"
- Chapter 5: "Final fixes"
- Chapter 6: "Actually final fixes"
- Chapter 7: "Please be the last fix"

## The Cleanup Fantasy

One day I'll:
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use conventional commits
- Keep commits atomic
- Write proper commit bodies

But today is not that day.

*What's your most memorable commit message? Share your git confession!*

**Pro tip:** If you're embarrassed by your commit messages, you can always rewrite history with `git rebase -i`. But let's be honest, you won't.
